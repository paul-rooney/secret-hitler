# Secret _(sockret?)_ Hitler
â€” a socket.io implementation of the Secret Hitler game, created by Mike Boxleiter, Tommy Maranges, Max Temkin, and Mac Schubert

_The year is 1932. The place is pre-WWII Germany. In Secret Hitler, players are German politicians attempting to hold a fragile liberal government together and stem the rising tide of Fascism. Watch out though&mdash;there are secret Fascists among you, and one player is Secret Hitler._

That&rsquo;s about all there is to it.
